# Airline-Satisfaction-Modelling
Capstone Project for University of Texas Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Analytics

This is the dilemma of a reputed US airline carrier ‘Falcon airlines’. They aim to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regards to their contribution to passenger satisfaction. Provided is a random sample of 90917 individuals who travelled using their flights. The on-time performance of the flights along with the passengers’ information is published in the csv file named ‘Flight data’. These passengers were asked to provide their feedback at the end of their flights on various parameters along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report csv labelled ‘Survey data’. In the survey, the passengers were explicitly asked whether they were satisfied with their overall flight experience and that is captured in the data of survey report under the variable labelled ‘Satisfaction’. The two objective of this project are-

To understand which parameters play an important role in swaying a passenger feedback towards ‘satisfied’.
To predict whether a passenger will be satisfied or not given the rest of the details are provided.
